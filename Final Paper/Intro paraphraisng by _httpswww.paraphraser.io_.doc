This rebranding pointed to progress benefit offerings, counting voice and information administrations, cash exchanges, and trade arrangements. In spite of endeavors to supply reasonable and available versatile communication administrations to understudies through the school-provided SIM card program, tall rates of understudy churn continue. This issue not as it were comes about in income loss but moreover influences understudy encounters. Hence, it is basic to investigate the components contributing to understudy churn and maintenance and to create prescient analytics models to distinguish at-risk understudies and plan techniques to improve maintenance rates. This study stems from the got to address the tall rates of understudy churn within the telecom industry, particularly inside the KNUST understudy populace using Telecel administrations. By understanding the basic components driving understudy churn, Telecel can execute focused on maintenance procedures, hence making strides benefit quality and understudy fulfillment. This investigate will advantage Telecel by upgrading client dependability and income and enhancing the scholastic environment by guaranteeing understudies have solid and viable broadcast communications administrations. This inquire about endeavors to develop a prescient analytics system to improve understudy maintenance and moderate churn inside Telecel administrations at KNUST. It centers on observing and assessing the components that affect understudy churn and maintenance. By diving into different factors such as benefit quality, estimating, client fulfillment, and engagement levels, the ponder points to disclose bits of knowledge significant for preemptively tending to churn. Through advanced explanatory strategies and data-driven techniques, it looks for to create a prescient demonstrate proficient at determining potential churn occasions and encouraging focused on intercessions. This activity points to invigorate Telecel's showcase position and contribute significantly to the headway of maintenance techniques inside the broadcast communications division. Issue Explanation In spite of the organization between KNUST and Telecel to supply reasonable versatile communication administrations to understudies, the school-provided SIM card program continues to confront critical challenges with tall rates of student churn. This progressing issue comes about in considerable income misfortune and adversely impacts understudy encounters. The primary issue lies within the need of a comprehensive understanding of the variables driving understudy churn and maintenance, which hampers the advancement of successful techniques to relieve these issues. There are insufficient broadcast communications administrations accessible to understudies, which influences their scholarly execution and generally well-being (Kapur, 2018). In a competitive telecom advertise, where understudies have numerous benefit supplier alternatives, holding this statistic gets to be progressively challenging (Kapur, 2018). Past considers have inspected different components impacting client churn, such as arrange quality, estimating, and client benefit (Mahajan et al., 2017; Banik and Sinha, 2020). Once more, Khan et al., (2019) investigated the components influencing benefit quality, client fulfillment, and client churn in the Pakistan media transmission administrations showcase. This think about looks at the different determinants of client churn in broadcast communications companies, giving bits of knowledge into components such as benefit quality, estimating methodologies, and client fulfillment. Moreover, Paterson and Guerrero, (2023) investigated prescient analytics for understudy maintenance in higher instruction educate. The investigate digs into prescient modeling methods utilized in higher instruction settings to estimate understudy steady loss, distinguishing indicators such as scholastic execution, socio-economic components, and engagement metrics. Whereas existing considers offer important experiences into customer churn in broadcast communications and understudy maintenance in higher instruction, there remains a critical investigate gap at the crossing point of these spaces. Particularly, there's limited investigate centering on the one of a kind flow of understudy churn inside broadcast communications administrations custom fitted to the setting of a particular institution, such as KNUST. Understanding the particular variables impacting understudy churn in this setting, counting the interaction between scholarly commitments and broadcast communications utilization designs, presents a crevice for investigation. Subsequently, there's a require for a focused on consider that synthesizes experiences from both broadcast communications and higher instruction inquire about to create a comprehensive understanding of understudy churn inside Telecel administrations at KNUST. By centering on the KNUST understudy populace, this think about looks for to fill this crevice by uncovering and analyzing information related to understudy socioeconomics, utilization designs, and other important components. The improvement of a prescient analytics demonstrate will help in recognizing at-risk understudies and defining procedures to progress retention rates. This approach will contribute to the body of information on client churn within the broadcast communications sector and give noteworthy bits of knowledge for Telecel and other telecom companies working in comparative settings. Investigate Destinations Main Objective To utilize prescient analytics to upgrade understudy retention and decrease churn inside Telecel's broadcast communications administrations at KNUST. Particular Targets To investigate the factors that impact understudy churn and maintenance among students in KNUST.
