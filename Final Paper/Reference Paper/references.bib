   abstract = {Bundling has become a popular marketing strategy in the telecommunication sector as telecom service providers all over the world have been offering various bundle types in order to increase customer loyalty and revenues. Yet our knowledge of exactly which profile of consumers reacts to bundles of service providers, and whether they would like to purchase bundle without explicit discount information, is limited. These two research questions are addressed in the present article. We examine current bundle choices and future intent of consumers through an empirical investigation, in the context of the Turkish market, one of the most dynamic and sizeable telecom sectors in the world. We build upon the extant theoretical work with empirical evidence, especially in the context of the heavily regulated Turkish market. Findings of this study can assist service providers develop and implement business strategies to expand the subscriber base.},

   abstract = {With the rapid growth of digital systems and associated information technologies, there is an emerging trend in the global economy to build digital customer relationship management (CRM) systems. This trend is more obvious in the telecommunications industry, where companies become increasingly digitalized. Customer churn prediction is a main feature of in modern telecomcommunication CRM systems. This research conducts a real-world study on customer churn prediction and proposes the use of boosting to enhance a customer churn prediction model. Unlike most research that uses boosting as a method to boost the accuracy of a given basis learner, this paper tries to separate customers into two clusters based on the weight assigned by the boosting algorithm. As a result, a higher risk customer cluster has been identified. Logistic regression is used in this research as a basis learner, and a churn prediction model is built on each cluster, respectively. The result is compared with a single logistic regression model. Experimental evaluation reveals that boosting also provides a good separation of churn data; thus, boosting is suggested for churn prediction analysis. © 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The Cox Proportional hazard model is a popular method to analyze right-censored survival data. This method is efficient to use if the proportional hazard assumption is fulfilled. This method does not provide an accurate conclusion if these assumptions are not fulfilled. The new innovative method with a non-parametric approach is now developing to predict the time until an event occurs based on machine learning techniques that can solve the limitation of CPH. The method is Random Survival Forest, which analyzes right-censored survival data without regard to any assumptions. This paper aims to compare the predictive quality of the two methods using the C-index value in predicting right-censored survival data on churn data of the telecommunication industry customers with 2P packages consisting of  Internet and TV, which are taken from all customer databases in the Jabodetabek area. The results show that the median value of the C-index of the RSF model is 0.769, greater than the median C-index value of the CPH model of 0.689. So the prediction quality of the RSF model is better than the CPH model in predicting the churn of the telecommunications industry customer.},

   abstract = {The wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive and managing customer churn is of great concern to wireless carriers as the market matures. Recent research has indicated that wireless rate plans are complicated and confusing to customers, and that wireless carriers are taking advantage of the situation by charging a very expensive per-minute rate for voice minutes beyond the monthly usage allowance. This article revisits an emerging database marketing strategy known as rate plan optimization and explores the importance of having customers on suitable rate plans. After conducting research on 11 525 residential customers from a Canadian wireless carrier, it is discovered that 55.4 per cent of them are subscribing to the wrong rate plans and these customers are churning faster than those with optimal ones. This article argues that proactively matching customers to optimal rate plans can contribute to customer churn reduction, although short-term profitability has to be sacrificed by the carriers in order to realize these benefits. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

   abstract = {In recent years, service providers have identified the proactive postsales service (PPS) as a viable measure for preempting service failures and their negative consequences. Due to the high costs associated with PPSs, companies are looking for ways to increase their efficiency. To understand how companies can increase their revenues and lower their costs, this study investigates how cross-selling activities and different media types affect the impact of a PPS on inbound service calls and customer churn. Based on a large-scale field experiment in the telecommunications industry, as well as a controlled lab experiment, the results demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the PPS and indicate two mediating effects. While the effect of cross-selling on customer churn and service calls is mediated by the customers’ uncertainty regarding the company’s motives, it is the customers’ perception of privacy invasion that mediates the influence of the contact medium on the effectiveness of the PPS. Our finding that PPS contacts have to be clear in their message and should not be perceived as invasive is an indication of the importance of service-(post)sales ambidexterity.},
